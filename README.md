Codestamp is a software license inserter. You can provide information and select which files in your project is to get the license automatically inserted with the information you provided. When working with C++ and C libraries I often find that there is a license at the top of each file. Manually inserting it file by file seemed rather tedious especially if you then wanted to remove or update the license later. So, I decided to write this application to solve the issue for me, even though I am sure there are much better alternatives out there.

## Overview

The application was written in C# as the .NET framework makes GUIs easy. I use the Metro user interface library to help give it some more modern styles that suits the modern age. Other than that, there isn’t much to say. Every functionality is achieved with the built in classes of .NET and it isn’t an advanced application.
