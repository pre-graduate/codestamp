Codestamp is a software license inserter. You can provide information and select which files in your project to get the license automatically inserted with the information you provided. When working with C++ and C libraries I I often find that there is a license at the top of each file. Manually inserting it file by file seemed rather tediuous especially if you then wanted to remove or update the license at a later date. So I decided to write this application to solve the issue for me, even though I am sure there are much better alternatives out there.

## Overview

The application was written in C# as the .NET framework makes GUIs really easy. I use the Metro user interface library to help gives it some more modern styles that suits the modern age. Other than that there isnt much to say. Every task of functionality if achieved with build in classes of .NET and it really isnt an advanced application.

## Development

I am not looking to develop this project further however if I was to I could start with the following.

* Additionally Licenses
* Insertion Location
* Insertion Preview

## License
